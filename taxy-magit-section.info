4.1 0.9.1
=========

*Fixes*
   • ‘taxy-magit-section-insert’ appends heading faces, so users can
     override (or merge with) the default.
   • ‘taxy-magit-section-format-items’ uses columns’ headers as their
     minimum width, which preserves each column’s width regardless of
     items’ values.

=======

   • ‘taxy-magit-section’ moved to separate package.
   • Better align columns whose values are images.
